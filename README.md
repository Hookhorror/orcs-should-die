# Orcs Should Die.
This is a game prototype for the first cycle in course TIES474 Pelinkehityshaaste in Jyväskylä University.

In this course we were given tasks to make multiple games over few weeks, with different rules for each task. The rule for this task was to make a DEmake of already existing game. Demake meant that we should simplify the core idea of the game to as simple consept as possible.

I did this project alone, and I think I learned great deal during it. I think I was able to make my code quite clear by making more functions, thus keeping the function shorter. It added a lot of descriptive value for the code itself and made reading it a lot smoother. I also tried to separate logic and object attributes to separate classes as much as I could. I also tried to make code clearer by using inheritance, but I'm not quite sure anymore if this project was big enough to actually see any difference. I also learned that it often pays to plan out even simple algorithms, even if they seem trivial at first.

This was also very brief project and all of the code has not been refined.
